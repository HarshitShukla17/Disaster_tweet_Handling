# Disaster-Tweets-Classification
Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets is a kaggle competition problem where we have to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. I participated in the Kaggle competition and solved the problem using Machine Learning and Natural Language processing. This repository contains all the code regarding the solution that I submitted at that time.
