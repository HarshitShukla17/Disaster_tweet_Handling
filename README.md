# Disaster-Tweets-Classification
Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets is a kaggle competition problem where we have to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. I participated in the Kaggle competition and solved the problem using Machine Learning and Natural Language processing and I got 562 rank after submitting my solution. This repository contains all the code regarding the solution that I submitted at that time.

Training accuracy was **98%** and testing accuracy was nearly **85%**, and the model used was a logistic regression model with L2 regulariser.
